They say Jesus was a nephew, you know what I'm sayin'?
They said his mom was a virgin
So when he was born, they told him he was sent from God
So he started goin' village to village helpin' the people and they killed his ass, that's crazy
That's crazy, man
They killed Jesus for helpin' the people
That's why I ain't got patience with people
In the Bible, God dealin' with evil
They said God did a deal with the Devil
That's the reason Job has soles on his feet
That's the reason Job lost his house
That's the reason Job lost his kids
I'm readin' the Bible like, "What is this?"
Adam made Eve off of one rib?
They made the world in seven days?
So Adam and Eve had a thousand kids?
Cain and Abel, they fell out beefin'
Me and my brother, we fell out beefin'
They said cocaine that was on the tree
What if Adam would've never fucked Eve?
Why Eve make that nigga eat that?
That's why I don't eat bitch food now
Job lost his whole fuckin' family
And they said God gave him a hundred cows
Like two hundred horses or somethin'
How the fuck is that worth my kids?
What I did to deserve to go through this?
Let me get this right, this because of Eve?
Okay, I fuck with Adam, but I'll beat the shit out of Eve
How the hell they live at the forbidden tree?
Somebody show me the forbidden tree
I believe in God, but I ain't too religious
How the fuck they really got a picture of Jesus?
Name one person who was alive with Jesus
How the fuck they tellin' me I need Jesus?
If I need Jesus, then where is Jesus?
So if I get shot, I'ma meet Jesus?
So I gotta die just to meet Jesus?
It's a fucked up world with fucked up people
The first religion, they worshipped the sun
They made some bullshit story 'bout that
They said the sun went down 'cause the sins
And the sun was never gon' come back
Every thousand years it's a new religion
Unc in the streets screamin', "New religion"
Pastor got diamonds, rockin' True Religion
Pray to who? You must be trippin'
Bitch, I'm prayin' to my money racks
They said we livin' in Revelations
Vaccine got us mutatin'
So fuck it then, I'ma go take it
If the whole world start purgin'
My daughter gon' still have a Lambo
I'ma have eighteen hundred guns
Thirty Audis and twenty Camaros
They said the world would end in 2012
I was sellin' crack in 2012
They talkin' about the calendar ended
Eight years later, a pandemic
Swine flu, Ebola
COVID-19, what's different?
All of that shit was killin' people
I ain't scared of that, guns kill people
I ain't scared of guns, AIDS kill people
I can die in a car crash
How the fuck you gon' tell me I'm goin' to Heaven?
Please tell me when you talked to the dead
Who you met that came from the dead?
Show me a picture and show me some proof
Explain to me why the fuck Benjamin Franklin stood his ass up on the roof
How he discover somethin' out the sky?
If that's the case, T-Rex discovered it

I ain't said enough
In school, I had a lot of questions

If he would've came to my block
Talkin' 'bout he discovered my trap
His ass would've probably got shot
How the fuck I'm African American?
Bitch, I'm American terrorist
Fifth grade, smarter than my parents
Grandma couldn't help with algebra
Grandma like, "What the fuck is algebra?"
She like, "That's a goddamn shame
Them people gon' keep makin' up shit tryna keep you in the same grade"
They tryna hide shit in the book
I was in jail readin' books
OG teach me 'bout real estate
Every landlord I know a crackhead
I'm in the hood with the slum lords
Grandma Jehovah's Witness, no Christians
Jehovah's Witnesses people move like a cult
They recruitin' people at they door
How you gon' force religion on somebody?
How you gon' change the Bible and tell it to everybody?
Why Jehovah's Witnesses don't like Christians?
They fightin' over Jesus' birthday
How the fuck y'all know Jesus' birthday?
Who the fuck is that white man Santa Claus?
They said that nigga was eatin' kids
Why would I let that man lie to my kids?
Why would I go out buyin' gifts
And blame it on a nigga named Santa?
Shit, a nigga climb through my roof, I'ma beat his ass in the head with a hammer
If you eat my cookies, beat you with a hammer
Drink the kids' milk, beat you with a hammer
You like a hundred somethin' buyin' toys
Well, Santa never dropped me off a toy
Let's get back to Jehovah's Witnesses
How the fuck all of y'all awake?
How the fuck y'all church so small, but it's a million of y'all everyday?
Shit, religious people startin' to scare me
Shit, the government wrote the Bible
They knew who was gon' win American Idol
I never liked Simon off American Idol
I ain't really like how he talked to black people
How the fuck Flava Flav still alive?

They said I was ugly as Flava Flav
Now I got twenty hoes like Flava Flav
Nigga dyin' for jewelry everyday
They caught the nigga who killed MO3
How the fuck he get caught in less than three weeks?

Put my pride to the side, bitch, I sacrificed
If that's the case, I'm Illuminati
How Tekashi get out before Shotti?
Why Jim Jones never went to jail?
And he was talkin' 'bout killin' a nigga

So what the fuck they thought was gon' happen?

Then I find out he wasn't hustlin'
He was with Swizz Beatz then went broke
Niggas thought Meek Mill wasn't gon' blow
I ain't never heard 'bout Meek Mill
Until he ran with that C.O.
I ain't sayin' Meek did the wrong thing
But he knew Ross was a C.O.

PS5 won't come out my lip
The Bible told you bitches is grimey
Whole Bible, bitches was lyin'
They believed that a virgin had kids
I hope my daughter don't tell me that shit
'Cause you ain't married and the baby ain't Jesus
Don't lie to me 'cause I ain't Jesus
My last bitch was an atheist
She talkin' 'bout pullin' tarot cards
She like, "Come on, Neph, let me tell your future"
I'm like, "Bitch, I'm off more molly than Future"

Who the fuck raised these niggas?
What scientist made these niggas?
What lab these niggas come from?
First time I watched I Am Legend I cried
Especially the part when his dog died
'Cause I feel his pain when you out in the streets
Then I seen another movie, he was butt naked with another man in between the sheets
I'm like, "Hell nah, that's I Am Legend?"
I'ma fuck Jada too, fuck I Am Legend
Well, Jada Pinkett, if you hear this song
I'll fuck you good and you ain't gon' regret it
I ain't August Alsina, you don't need him
If he was real, he would've knocked out Will
Yo' kids grown, fuck that nigga

And these niggas, they move like bitches do
I don't even wanna get in the industry
'Cause if I do, I'm doin' somethin' crazy
I'ma fuck Keke Palmer, get her pregnant
Then leave her single with a baby
Don't judge me, that's what Adam did
If Adam and Eve had two kids
Once Adam got a taste of that fruit
He went to the left and found him a bitch
Shit, Cain and Abel was trippin' anyway
Shit, they tryna kill each other with an axe
They put this shit all in the Bible
So you know damn well this ain't cap
They say there's seventy-seven sextillion stars in the sky
I ain't even heard that number before until they told me that lie
I'm like, "How the fuck— hold on
Which telescope and what person count that with they eyes?"
When I was in church, I had questions
My grandma like, "Hold on, grandson got a question"
They passed me the mic at the kingdom hall
I'm like, "Who told y'all it's that many stars?"
They told me, "Don't question the Bible"
I'm like, "Grandma, stop goin' to the kingdom hall
Them people ain't your friends anyway"

If somebody else die, it was meant to go
Y'all the ones who put that shit in the Bible
How the fuck y'all talkin' 'bout "turn the other cheek"
When y'all killin' black people left and right?

# Slitherman vs Nephew
Slitherman
Walk down and grab you
Climb through yo’ window, break in and stab you
Slitherman control yo’ body
Make you eat more Molly
Slitherman fuck the community up
For Christmas time, I’m buying switches
Take yo’ liver and sell yo’ liver
I hate when Slitherman take over my thoughts
Look at this machete I just bought
6 people in the house, they all dyin’
I put gasoline in their air fryer
7 grams of Molly in the Henny
And offer that shit to everybody
Lace a blunt, pass it to everybody
I'm Jim Jones not John Gotti
Dunk the Backwood in embalming fluid
Convince a bitch to do a triple stack
Roll up a Backwood and mix it with crack
Destroy yo’ whole family with crack
Put gasoline all over yo’ driver seat
Soon as you light yo’ blunt, ka-boom!
This machete I got is new
Stab you in yo’ fuckin’ pressure point
Twist yo’ neck until it snap
Fuck Halloween, I’ll kill in September
Fuck Friday the 13th, I’ll kill on the 1st
Fuck the 31st, I’ll kill on the 3rd
I’ll kill Tuesday at 3 o’clock
I’ll kill a bitch at Sunday service
Slitherman produced this beat
I put fish hooks through yo’ eyelids
And pour bleach all down yo’ throat
And tattoo "I hate myself" on yo' head
Knock yo’ grandad out a wheelchair
Slap the fuck out yo’ grandma
Stab all your lil’ cousins
I’ll break in yo’ house with no hands
Put cuts all over your body with a razor
And spray yo’ ass with ammonia
Oh, you thirsty? I got a concoction!
I wanna see you cough up blood
I wanna see yo’ family cry over yo’ body
And get sturdy on that bitch grave
I pull up like I know what you did last summer
Freddy Kruger was a rapist, I hate him
Fuck Candyman, you ain’t gotta say my name
Fuck Jeepers Creepers, that nigga ugly
Fuck Exorcist, that shit stupid
